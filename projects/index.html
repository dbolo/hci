        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          You will create a compelling single-page design that features a sign-up process to get new
          users to join some type of project, such as an email list, a software beta test, or an
          open-source community. Focus on designing for an effortless, engaging entry of personal
          information; and friendly, frictionless client-side tests and alerts for malformed,
          missing, or incomplete information. The goal of this project is to experiment with
          patterns of interaction that persuade someone to sign up for whatever it is you’re
          offering, which is not at all an easy task.

      <section class="description">
        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          Some of the very worst designed websites you’ll come across are for banking, credit card
          payment, HR portals, and other non-optional websites for certain classes of customers or
          workers. Self-selected teams of 3-4 students will redesign the MyIIT login page, the
          welcome page/tab, and all necessary pages for achieving a specific student-user task (some
          examples: generating a class schedule, dropping a class, paying a tuition bill, removing a
          registration hold, or any other task that you achive through MyIIT as a student). Your
          redesigned portal should be designed and developed according to sound principles of
          human-computer interaction, user experience, and emotional design.

          <li>CSS requirements:
            <ol>
              <li>
                CSS file should open with a set of reset styles (such as the minified Eric Meyer
                resets from class demos)
              </li>
              <li>
                Only relative units (em, rem, vm, %) in your CSS; no px, pt, or other absolute
                units allowed
              </li>
              <li>
                Use at least two min-width media queries to enhance your mobile-first styles for
                larger screens
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>JavaScript requirements:
            <ol>
              <li>
                JavaScript that throws no uncaught errors and is loaded unobtrusively (no JavaScript
                event attributes in your HTML, in other words; attach events to any elements
                requiring interaction)
              </li>
              <li>
                JavaScript that uses function closures and other techniques to avoid polluting the
                global <code>window</code> namespace
              </li>
              <li>
                JavaScript that uses only asynchronous methods and callbacks
              </li>
            </ol>
          <li>Git requirements:
            <ol>
              <li>
                A Git repository with frequent commits and meaningful commit messages that
                accurately reflect each set of changes that you make
              </li>
              <li>
                Use of the command-line Git program on your computer; no commits made through the
                GitHub web interface (this isn’t kindergarten)
              </li>
              <li>
                GitHub repository must contain <b>only</b> the files and commits from this project
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
