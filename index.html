      <p>
        The final project of the course asks you to subject your group’s Web Portal Redesign project
        to a series of low-stakes user tests, and to make recommendations for the agile, incremental
        improvements to the Web Portal Redesign project based on what you learn through your user
        tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should structure your tests around the guidance in Chapter 9 of Krug’s book. You are
        welcome to use as a starting point and/or modify his sample script and recording release
        form available <a href="http://www.sensible.com/downloads-rsme.html">at Krug’s website</a>.
        However, your script must be modified to match your specific project and tasks (obviously).
      </p>
      <h4>Project Goals</h4>
      <ul class="goals">
        <li>
          Evaluate user interface designs with human subjects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Demonstrate how user-centered concerns can be incorporated into system development life
          cycles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Explain the need to evaluate system usability.
        </li>
        <li>
          Conduct usability tests on mobile and traditional devices
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Deliverables &amp; Milestones</h4>
      <p>
        Unlike previous projects, your deliverables for this assignment should be handed in to the
        instructor as a Dropbox or Google Drive share URL (do <b>not</b> use the internal sharing
        function on Dropbox or Drive with the instructor). The URL should point to a folder
        containing thoughtfully named files and folders containing each deliverable listed below.
      </p>
      <ol class="deliverables">
        <li>
          Testing script (submitted to instructor before testing, by 4/20), which should include a
          welcome to your participant, an explanation of the process, and an outline of the exact
          tasks you will be asking participants to complete
        </li>
        <li>

     <h3 id="project-two">Project Two: Media-Rich Single-Page Site <small>Due March 21, 11:59pm CT</small></h3>
      <p>
        Single-page sites have seen a resurgent interest in recent years, particularly for
        showcasing products, services, or an entire company. See <a
        href="https://onepagelove.com/">One Page Love</a> for a gallery of examples. This project
        requires you to engage in well-crafted, mobile-first responsive web design with careful,
        bandwidth-friendly treatment of rich media elements as well as responsive images for
        traditional and high-DPI/“retina” screens. You will use the site to tell the story of a
        particular company, product, or organization, and implement elements of your onboarding
        project (Project One). Alternatively, you may use this project to build a one-page site for
        that tells your own professional story, perhaps a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#user--organization-pages">GitHub user page</a>
        at &lt;username&gt;.github.io.
      </p>
      <p>
        By engaging in storytelling, you should think both about how the text content of a site
        tells a story, but also how image, audio, and video also helps to tell a story. As we will
        see in the remaining projects in class, good HCI is also good story-telling. It’s a story
        that users/readers can insert themselves into. This project invites you to get even stronger
        in your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, while also thinking about techniques and
        strategies to get a specific group of people to want to read all the way through a page.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project requires you to create a compelling page design and sign-up process to get new
        users to join some type of project: an email list, a software beta test, or an open-source
        community. Project emphasis will be on effortless, engaging entry of personal information;
        and friendly, frictionless client-side tests and alerts for malformed, missing, or
        incomplete information. The goal of this project is to hit on particular patterns of
        interaction that persuade someone to sign up for whatever it is you’re offering—not at all
        an easy task.

      <p>
        Some of the very worst designed websites you’ll come across are for banking/credit card
        payment, web portals, and other non-optional websites for certain classes of customers or
        workers. For this project, self-selected teams of 3-4 students will redesign the login page,
        the welcome page/tab, and all necessary pages for achieving a specific student-user task
        (some examples: generating a class schedule, dropping a class, paying a tuition bill,
        removing a registration hold, or any other task that you achive through MyIIT as a student).
        Your redesigned portal should be designed and developed according to sound principles of
        human-computer interaction, user experience, and emotional design.

        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>
          <b>From the Catalog</b>: Students in this course will learn the importance of
          human-computer interaction design and the effectiveness of user-centered design. The
          course will cover a survey of methods frequently used by the HCI profession, such as
          usability testing and prototyping, as well as general design principles and how to use
          design guidelines. A particular emphasis will be placed on usability for Web site
          engineering, and students will apply knowledge from the field in the design and
          construction of user-centered Web sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Extended Description</b>: Additionally, this course favors a mobile-first approach to
          web design and development, with special attention to the challenges of designing
          touch-screen interfaces. Students will learn development methods based on prototyping and
          rapid iteration, supported by version control and low-stakes user-testing. The design
          principles the course will emphasize include color, material design, rich web typography,
          and responsive grid-based page layout. Accessibility, progressive enhancement, and
          thoughtful, thoroughly researched use of edge technologies and polyfills will be treated
          as guiding techniques throughout the course. Student work is organized around projects of
          varying size and scale, emphasizing the course's hands-on, theory-grounded approach to web
          design and development.

            My policy for assigning books: they are all required in the edition indicated; the total
            retail pricetag for the entire course should be less than $100 (this one is $97 on the
            high end); and each book should be worthy of a place on your bookshelf or electronic
            device of choice well after the class has ended.

        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Assignment Submission</h3>
          <p>
            All assignments for this course will be submitted via email to the instructor, at
            karl.stolley@gmail.com. Submissions should <b>not</b> include email attachments, but
            rather URLs pointing to your project’s Git repository or, for certain assignments as
            indicated, Dropbox Share URLs. Examples will be demonstrated in class.
          </p>
          <h3>Late Work</h3>
          <p>
            I do not accept late work. All work must be submitted before the date and time specified
            in each project description. Weekly work is due before the start of the first class
            meeting each week.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Participation</h3>
          <p>
            Your active participation in class and in online discussions and chats is required both
            for your own success in the class, and for the success of the class as a whole. I do not
            give reading quizzes, but I assign a lot of reading. And I expect you to be prepared
            to discuss that reading.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Course Technology Policy</h3>
          <p>
            Technology is an essential part of learning and day-to-day living. It is therefore
            essential to this class. You are just as responsible for learning to command various
            technologies as for any other course content. Difficulty with technology is not an
            acceptable excuse for being unprepared for class.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are having trouble with technology or any other material covered in this course,
            it is your professional responsibility to do research beyond the resources and guidance
            provided in class and find materials that work for you. I also encourage all students to
            meet with me during my office hours or at another arranged time. I prefer that you
            contact me via email or GChat well in advance of assignment and project deadlines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that coming to class with broken or malfunctioning work is far better than showing
            up with nothing but an excuse like “I just didn’t get it.” For most of the semester, it
            is expected that you’ll show up with broken work. When you’re learning, effort is more
            important than perfection. Just be sure to put in the effort early, and not the night
            before a project is due.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, I have asked you to sign up for a GitHub account for this class. Note that
            GitHub accounts are public, as are most social-type accounts. <b>To protect your privacy
            you are certainly allowed to use a pseudonym/alias for GitHub and any other account.</b>
            At the same time, you might want to think about how establishing GitHub and other
            accounts under your own name, in cases where you conduct yourself professionally, might
            actually be an asset to your online presence, and the results that future schools or
            employers turn up when they search for you on Google and elsewhere.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
          <p>
            As with any course at IIT, you are expected to uphold
            <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook/fine-print/code-academic-honesty">the Code of Academic Honesty</a>
            as described in the
            <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook">IIT Student Handbook</a>). All
            work for this course must be your own original effort, including print and digital page
            design and computer code. Summarizations and quotations of text, as well as any use of
            open-source code libraries and images not of your own making, should be clearly cited as
            legally and ethically warranted and rhetorically appropriate. Access, storage,
            dissemination, and other use of data from third-party sources must conform to the
            source’s terms of service, licensing, and other relevant legal and ethical restrictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that in whole or in
            part may violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please contact me immediately and before
            the work is due. The consequences of academic dishonesty are severe. Any student who
            violates the Code of Academic Honesty will be subject to expulsion from this course with
            a failing grade, and I will report the student to the Chair of the Department of
            Humanities, who may take additional disciplinary action, including reporting
            violations to the relevant offices of Undergraduate or Graduate Academic Affairs.
          </p>

          <h3>Special Needs Statement</h3>
          <p>
            Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities. In
            order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the
            Center for Disability Resources. The <a href="https://web.iit.edu/cdr">Center for
            Disability Resources</a> is located in IIT Tower, 3424 S. State Street - 1C3-2  (on the
            first floor). Contact the Center by telephone at 312-567-5744, by TDD at 312-567-5135,
            or via email at disabilities@iit.edu
          </p>
          <p>
            Students who have any difficulty (either permanent or temporary) that might affect their
            ability to perform in class should contact me privately, either in person or via email,
            at the start of the semester or as a documented difficulty arises. Methods, materials,
            or deadlines will be adapted as necessary to ensure equitable participation for all
            students.
